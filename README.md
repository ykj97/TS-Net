# TS-Net

Tumor segmentation-Net (TS-Net) is a breast tumor segmentation model for an orthotopic breast cancer model using MRI.


TS-Net involves replacing the encoder of U-Net with a pre-trained ResNet34 to improve performance.
The model was trained using a sample size of n=19 from the untreated group and then subsequently assessed on both the untreated group (n=5) and treated group (n=6).
